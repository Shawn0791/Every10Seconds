## Game Overview

A game based on the "Every Ten Seconds" theme.  

Due to the time constraints of the project, there were still a lot of bugs that were not fixed at the end.


## Project Responsibilities

Programmers and Gameplay Designers

## Design Concept

Designed around several core mechanics based on "every ten seconds."

## Game Mechanics

Each level features a unique game mechanic that changes every ten seconds. In the first level, the map rotates 90 degrees every ten seconds, causing the walls and floor to switch identities. In the second level, smart blocks randomly roll over the surrounding empty spaces. In the third level, both players swap positions every ten seconds.

## Game Highlights

A moving maze with walls and floors swapping places; intelligent blocks detecting and rolling over nearby empty spaces; an incredible maze that rotates with player movement.

## Game controls:

Character 1: WSAD & Space

Character 2: Up, Down, Left, Right & Number 0
